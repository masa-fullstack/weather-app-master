<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](./images/demo.png)

Developed with NextJS + react-select + Tailwindcss.<br/>
<br/>
For the NextJS template, I used the NextJS Typescript Boilerplate from the official examples.<br/>
<br/>
In order to support CORS, we used the NEXTJS API as PROXY.
<br/>
For CSS, I used Tailwindcss.<br/>
During development, I used docker-compose to build the development environment.<br/>

Thanks for viewing :)
